# asset_downloads
As of v0.0.18, the ivoyager_core editor plugin will offer to download and update assets on its own to match its current version (release or non-release). I.e., you don't need to be here.

For manual asset management, downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/ivoyager/asset_downloads/releases). Release assets always have tag similar to "v0.0.18". Development (non-release) assets have appended ".dev.\<date\>" (e.g., "v0.0.19.dev.20240906").

Current:
* v0.0.19.dev.20240911 (current development assets for ivoyager_core _master_ branch)
* v0.0.18 (release assets for ivoyager_core v0.0.18)
  
Obsolete:
* v0.0.19.dev.20240906
* (Earlier release assets can be downloaded from [ivoyager_core/releases](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_core/releases))
* (Earlier development assets can be downloaded from [non_release_assets](https://github.com/ivoyager/non_release_assets))
