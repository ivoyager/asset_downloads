# asset_downloads
As of v0.0.18, the ivoyager_core editor plugin will offer to download and update assets on its own to match its current version (release or non-release). I.e., you don't need to be here.

Asset downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/ivoyager/asset_downloads/releases). Release assets always have tag similar to "v0.0.18". Development (non-release) assets always have a date tag: e.g., "2024-03-15".

Current:
* v0.0.18 (release assets for ivoyager_core v0.0.18)
  
Obsolete:
* (Earlier release assets can be downloaded from [ivoyager_core/releases](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_core/releases))
* (Earlier development assets can be downloaded from [non_release_assets](https://github.com/ivoyager/non_release_assets))
